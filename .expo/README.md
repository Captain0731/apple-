# Expo Configuration

This directory is managed by Expo CLI during runtime. 

You don't need to modify anything here manually.

## What's this folder?

The `.expo` folder contains:
- Local development configuration
- Cache files
- Build artifacts
- Device registration for development

## Should I commit this?

No! The `.expo` folder is already in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to version control.

## Issues?

If you're experiencing build or runtime issues, you can safely delete this folder and run `npm start` again to regenerate it.
