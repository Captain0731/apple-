- Try using mobile hotspot instead of WiFi
- Make sure firewall isn't blocking port 19000/19001

## üì± Backend Integration

Currently, the app works with **mock data** (sample/dummy data). To connect to a real backend:

1. Start your FastAPI server
2. Note the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
3. Open `src/config/api.js` in the project
4. Update `BASE_URL` with your server URL
5. Save and reload the app

## üí° Development Tips

### To restart the app:
- Shake your phone (physical device)
- Or press Ctrl+M (Android) / Cmd+D (iOS) in simulator
- Select "Reload"

### To see console logs:
- They appear in the terminal where you ran `npm start`
- Or in the browser dev tools

### To stop the server:
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal

## üé® Making Changes

If you want to modify the app:

1. Open the project folder in any code editor (VS Code recommended)
2. Make changes to files in `src/` folder
3. Save the file
4. The app will automatically reload on your phone

## üìö Useful Commands

```bash
# Start the app
npm start

# Start and clear cache
npm start -- --clear

# Run on Android emulator (if you have Android Studio)
npm run android

# Run on iOS simulator (Mac only, requires Xcode)

```
